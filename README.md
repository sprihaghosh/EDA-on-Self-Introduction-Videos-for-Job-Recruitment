# EDA-on-Self-Introduction-Videos-for-Job-Recruitment

In the context of our analysis, we have been provided with a dataset comprising information from 10 candidates. This dataset encompasses emotion scores, transcript scores, and the associated transcripts derived from their introductory videos.
 Our primary objective is to conduct an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) to extract valuable insights and patterns from this dataset. Through this process, we aim to determine whether the candidates should be recruited or not based on data-driven insights.
We will focus on the comprehensive understanding of the candidatesâ€™ emotional expressions, analysis of their communication skills, and check for desirable areas of expertise from their education, skills and experience as mentioned in the transcripts.
